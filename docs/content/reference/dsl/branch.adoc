[.lead]
The `operator>>` overload for rules and `else_` branch rule.

{{% interface %}}
----
template <typename T>
concept _branch-rule_ = _rule_<T> && â€¦;
----

A _branch rule_ is a rule that has an associated condition.
The parsing algorithm can efficiently check whether the condition would match at the current reader position.
As such, they are used to make decisions:
once a branch condition matches, the branch is taken without backtracking.

[#branch]
== Branch rule `lexy::dsl::operator>>`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl
{
    struct _branch_ {}; // models _branch-rule_

    consteval _branch_ operator>>(_branch-rule_ auto condition, _rule_ auto then);

    consteval _branch_ operator+(_branch_ br, _rule_ auto then);
}
----

[.lead]
`operator>>` (branch) turns a rule into a branch rule by giving it another branch rule as condition.

Parsing::
  Parses `condition` and `then` in {{% docref sequence %}}.
Branch parsing::
  Tries to parse `condition` and backtracks if that backtracks.
  Then parses `then`.
Errors::
  All errors raised by `condition` and `then`.
  The rule then fails if they have failed.
Values::
  All values produced by `condition` followed by all values of `then`.

If the result of `operator>>` is used in the beginning of a {{% docref sequence %}} with a rule, i.e. as `(condition >> rule1) + rule2`,
this is equivalent to `condition >> rule1 + rule2`, i.e. the original branch is extended.
`rule1 + (condition >> rule2)`, on the other hand, is equivalent to `rule1 + condition + rule2`.

{{% playground_example if "Only parse a fraction if preceded by a dot" %}}

NOTE: A branch rule is only parsed as a branch if its required.
If you just use it by itself, the branch condition does not matter.
Use {{% docref "lexy::dsl::if_" %}} to conditionally execute a branch.

CAUTION: If `then` is also a branch rule, it will still only use `condition` as the condition.

[#else_]
== Branch rule `lexy::dsl::else_`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl
{
    constexpr _branch-rule_ auto else_;
}
----

[.lead]
`else_` is a branch rule that is always taken and consumes nothing.

(Branch) Parsing::
  Always succeeds without consuming anything.
Errors::
  None.
Values::
  None.

The rule is meant to be used in combination with link:#branch[`operator>>`] to create a branch that should always be taken.
