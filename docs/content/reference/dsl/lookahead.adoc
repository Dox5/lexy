== Branch rule `lexy::dsl::lookahead`

{{% interface %}}
----
namespace lexy::dsl
{
    consteval _branch-rule_ auto lookahead(_token-rule_ auto needle,

[.lead]
`lookahead` is a {{% branch-rule %}} that checks if `needle` is found before `end`.

Parsing::
  Always succeeds without consuming anything.
Branch parsing::
  If it can match `needle` before `end` is matched or before EOF is reached, the branch is taken without having consumed any input.
  Otherwise, it backtracks.
Errors::
  No errors are raised as the rule can only backtrack and never fails.
Values::
  None.

{{% godbolt_example lookahead "Look for an `=` sign before deciding on a branch" %}}

NOTE: Automatic {{% docref whitespace %}} skipping is disabled while parsing `needle` or `end`.

CAUTION: This rule requires backtracking, which can slow down parsing.
